            <p>
              I am a senior in Computer Science at the University of Utah pursuing a BS degree. I am a well-rounded, passionate, and reliable individual with aspirations to become a full stack Software Engineer.
              With many successful projects, and over 1 year of work experience I believe that I am qualified for many jobs nationwide. All of my current experience has come together
              to make me well versed in many languages, architectures, and frameworks. I am excited and ready to pursue a career anywhere I go, and cannot wait to see what the future has in store.
