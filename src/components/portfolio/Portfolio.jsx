            <h3>This is my TankWars game, and it was made with a partner. We created a server and client to run this game using MVC architecture. 
              The server allowed for multiple clients to connect and interact with eachother. The game consisted of multiple tanks and an environment more complicated than the one above.
              The tanks were able to move around and fire projectiles at one another causing damage to the tank that was hit. This project was written in C# using Visual Studio.</h3>

            <h3>This project was a mock google spreadsheets project. For this project we created a server and client similar to the Tank Wars game, but this was written in C.
              Similar to the TankWars server, we allowed multiple clients to connect and interact with eachother. Clients could see other clients: positions, edits, deletes, and more
              all in real time. This was all written and designed by hand, produced in a team of 6.
